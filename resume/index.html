  <h1>Resume</h1>

  <h2><b>My Web Presence</b></h2>
    <p>Hello and thank you for reading my resume.
      To start with talking about myself and my web presence, I have been working with and using technology all my life.
      I have some experience in working with not only on various softwars on computers but on physical hardware aswell.
      In highschool I was certified in Word, Powerpoint, and Excel as well as some Adobe softwares I will go into.
      Later in my time in highschool I became certified in Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator to name a few.
      There are alot of different things I would like to do with my skills now, and skills that I pick up along the way in my life.
      <strong>I would like to work on Animation just creating little shorts and other things like that. I would also like to go into Game Design and work on the animation, art, or story for games.</strong>
      Most importantly I just really enjoy using all the different softwares available. I find it really satisfying and fun to see your finished product all come together and see everything work in the end, it makes me want to work on more things and gives me this drive to work harder.</p>
